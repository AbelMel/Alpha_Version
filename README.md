Abel
- Created UI (Menu, Death Screen).
- Created/Edited Scripts that came with the assets.
- Created OnCollision Script, so when enemy hits player, the player dies.
- Created bullet inpact on enemy, this is where enemy will take damage when the bullet hits him.

Luke 
- Chose the right assets from the asset store.
- Created the UI for the Alpha but it wasn't functionable.


Assets
Low Poly Pack - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/low-poly-fps-pack-free-sample-144839 (Used only the pistol, knife and gernade. The asset came with the code already it just had to be looked at and edited a little so it can have function against the enemy that has been added)
